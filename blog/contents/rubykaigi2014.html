  Fortunately, the reaction of audience was very good.
  I talked to and was talked to by many Rubyist.
  It was a very good experience for me.

  I was asked <b>"How long does it take to learn Egison?"</b> by Koichi Sasada after my presentation.
  I would like to write here a clear answer for that.
</p>

<p>
  <b>To learn to use just pattern-matching of Egison, I think people who can already write programs will need just an hour.</b>
  To understand the mechanism and the theory behind Egison pattern-matching, I think people who already know the theory of functional languages will need 3 hours and people who don't know that will need 20 hours.
</p>

<p>
  I have implemented the gem to spread Egison pattern-matching to more people.
  I believe it is not so difficult and don't want to make people hesitate to learn it.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, I would like to thank staffs and everyone at RubyKaigi. I had a very great time!
