  Today, I'd like to write my perspective of programming languages.
  First of all, the figure below is my mind map on programming languages.

  I think there are three aspects to evaluate programming languages.
  The first is <i>mathematical abstraction</i>.
  It enables us to write algorithms directly.
  The second is <i>computer abstraction</i>.
  It enables us to control computers directly.
  The last is <i>human understandability</i>.
  It enables us to learn and use the language easily.

  As you know, I'm currently focusing on mathematical abstraction of programming languages and created Egison.
  I thought abstraction of data deconstruction is the biggest hole of the existing theory of programming languages.

<p>
  Egison is pioneering the area in the figure below.

  Egison is the first language that realized all features in the area of the figure above.
  I believe that the impact of this contribution has as great in the history of programming languages
  as other historical abstractions such as high-order functions from Lisp and Scheme and automatic type inferences from ML.
