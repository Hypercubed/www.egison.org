          <h2>Why a new language?</h2>

          <p>
            Egison is the world's first programming language that can directly represent pattern-matching against unfree data types.<br/>
            An unfree data type is a data types whose data have no standard form.<br/>
            For example, a type of sets is a unfree data type.<br/>
            This is because a collection {a, b, c} is equal with {b, a, c} and {a, a, b, c}, when we see them as sets.<br/>
            The pattern-matching of the existing programming languages only support data types whose data have a standard form, such as lists.<br/>
            Therefore, we need to translate and regard them as data which have a canonical form when we treat unfree data types.<br/>
            For example, a set would be always treated as a list.<br/>
            Many programmers think this is unavoidable, and in fact, it is a latent stress of programming.<br/>
            I've created Egison to get rid of this restriction and makes programming dramatically simple.
          </p>

          <p>
            Creation of a new programming language with an essentially new feature is to fill a hole in the abstraction of the existing languages.<br/>
            If there is a hole of abstraction in a language, there is something we can't represent directly and intuitively in the language.
            The ideal programming language is the language that filled all holes.<br/>
            I think <b>modularization of pattern-matching</b> is the biggest hole remained.<br/>
            (And I'm believing it is the last hole remained.)<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            To realize molularization of pattern-matching, I've designed pattern-matching system that has all following features.
          </p>
 
          <dl>
            <dt>Modularization of the way of pattern-matching</dt>
            <dd>
              We can define the way of pattern-matching for each data types.<br/>
              For example, we can define how to pattern-match against lists, multiset, and sets respectively.<br/>
            </dd>
            
            <dt>Multiple pattern-matching results</dt>
            <dd>
              We can handle pattern-matching that has multiple results with backtracking.<br/>
              This feature is necessary to pattern-match with unfree data types.<br/>
              Because unfree data have many forms for same data, so there are multiple ways of destruction.<br/>
            </dd>
            
            <dt>Non-linear patterns</dt>
            <dd>
              Bindings in a pattern can be refer in the same pattern.<br/>
              It is necessary to write useful patterns for unfree data types.<br/>
            </dd>
            
            <dt>Patterns have lexical scoping</dt>
            <dd>
              We can modularize usefule patterns with <i>pattern-functions</i>, functions that receive patterns and return a pattern.<br/>
              Since a pattern-function has lexical scoping, bindings for pattern-variables in the argument patterns and the body of pattern-functions don't conflict.<br/>
              Useful patterns can be reused in many places in a program without worry of name clash.<br/>
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <p>
            Finally, I'd like to demonstrate the following short programs that show the elegance of Egison.
