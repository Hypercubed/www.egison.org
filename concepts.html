          <h2 id="what-is-egison">What is Egison?</h2>

          <p>
            Egison is the world's first programming language that can directly represent pattern-matching against <i>unfree data types</i>.<br/>
            An unfree data type is a data types whose data have no standard form.<br/>
            For example, a type of sets is a unfree data type.<br/>
            This is because a collection <i>{a, b, c}</i> is equal with <i>{b, a, c}</i> and <i>{a, a, b, c}</i>, when we see them as sets.<br/>
            The pattern-matching of the existing programming languages only support data types whose data have a standard form, such as lists.<br/>
            Therefore, we need to translate and regard them as data which have a canonical form when we treat unfree data types.<br/>
            For example, a set would be always treated as a list.<br/>
            Many programmers think this is unavoidable, and in fact, it is a latent stress of programming.<br/>
            Egison gets rid of this restriction and makes programming dramatically simple!

          <h2 id="why-new-language">Why new language?</h2>

          <p>
            I think the pattern-matching of Egison is the big innovation in programming languages.<br/>
            Implementation of the Egison pattern-matching has big influence for whole design of the programming language.<br/>
            The patterns and the new notions <i>matchers</i>, which defines how to pattern-matching for each data type, have really important role as functions.<br/>
            What was the best design changes by introducing new pattern-matching.<br/>
            Additionally, I had to do a lot of experiments to theorize it.<br/>
          </p>

          <h2 id="features">Four features of pattern-matching of Egison</h2>

          <p>
            To realize molularization of pattern-matching, I've designed pattern-matching system that has all following features.
          </p>
 
          <dl>
            <dt>Modularization of the way of pattern-matching</dt>
            <dd>
              We can define the way of pattern-matching for each data types.<br/>
              For example, we can define how to pattern-match against lists, multiset, and sets respectively.<br/>
            </dd>
            
            <dt>Multiple pattern-matching results</dt>
            <dd>
              We can handle pattern-matching that has multiple results with backtracking.<br/>
              This feature is necessary to pattern-match with unfree data types.<br/>
              Because unfree data have many forms for same data, so there are multiple ways of destruction.<br/>
            </dd>
            
            <dt>Non-linear patterns</dt>
            <dd>
              Bindings in a pattern can be refer in the same pattern.<br/>
              It is necessary to write useful patterns for unfree data types.<br/>
            </dd>
            
            <dt>Patterns have lexical scoping</dt>
            <dd>
              We can modularize usefule patterns with <i>pattern-functions</i>, functions that receive patterns and return a pattern.<br/>
              Since a pattern-function has lexical scoping, bindings for pattern-variables in the argument patterns and the body of pattern-functions don't conflict.<br/>
              Useful patterns can be reused in many places in a program without worry of name clash.<br/>
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <h2 id="demonstration">Short demonstration</h2>

          <p>
            Finally, I'd like to demonstrate the following short code that shows the elegance of Egison.
          </p>
 
          <textarea id="egison-program" name="code"></textarea>

          <button id="run-egison" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" data-loading-text="Loading..." role="button">Run</button>

          <pre id="egison-result"></pre>
            
          <h2 id="next">What to do next...</h2>
          
          <p>
            <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" href="/getting-started.html" role="button">Install Egison!</a>

      var editor;
      $.get("/api/source", { path: "sample/one-minute.egi"}, function(data) {
        var e = document.getElementById("egison-program");
        e.value = data.content;
        editor = CodeMirror.fromTextArea(document.getElementById("egison-program"), {
          matchBrackets: true,
          lineNumbers: true,
          viewportMargin: Infinity
        });
      }, "json");
      
      $(document).ready(function(){
        $('.btn').button()

        $('#run-egison').click(function() {
          $('#run-egison').prop("disabled", true);
          $('#run-egison').html("Running...");
          $.post("/api/eval", { program: editor.getValue() }, function(data) {
            data.output = data.output.replace(/</g, "&lt;");
            data.output = data.output.replace(/>/g, "&gt;");
            $('#egison-result').html(data.output);
