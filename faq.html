          <p>
            Please try Egison and give <a href="/~egi/">me</a> feedback.<br/>
            If it is interesting for you, please talk and tweet about Egison.<br/>
            What is the happiest thing for me is to read new Egison code by the people with various backgrounds.<br/>
            I believe Egison will be helpful and give breakthrough for the various fields in the way I've never imagine.<br/>
          </p>
          <p>
            I really appreciate if you could create the extensions of the other languages such as Haskell, Ruby and Python.<br/>
            I think these work will have great impact.<br/>
            I'd like to do that by myself.<br/>
            But I don't have thorough knowledge of each language to implement extensions, yet.<br/>

          <p>
            Pattern-matching of Egison is realized with backtracking as Prolog.<br/>
            The difference is that Egison realized these strong expression in pattern-matching.<br/>
            The pattern-matching itself of Prolog is similar with ordinal pattern-matching of the other functional languages.<br/>
            The mechanism of pattern-matching is briefly written <a href="/manual/mechanism.html">here</a>.
