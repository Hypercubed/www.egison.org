          <h3 id="what-is-egison">What is Egison?</h3>

          <p>
            Egison is the world's first programming language that can directly represent pattern-matching against <i>unfree data types</i>.<br/>
            An unfree data type is a data types whose data have no standard form.<br/>
            For example, a type of sets is a unfree data type.<br/>
            This is because a collection <i>{a, b, c}</i> is equal with <i>{b, a, c}</i> and <i>{a, a, b, c}</i>, when we see them as sets.<br/>
            The pattern-matching of the existing programming languages only support data types whose data have a standard form, such as lists.<br/>
            Therefore, we need to translate and regard them as data which have a canonical form when we treat unfree data types.<br/>
            For example, a set would be always treated as a list.<br/>
            Many programmers think this is unavoidable, and in fact, it is a latent stress of programming.<br/>
            Egison gets rid of this restriction and makes programming dramatically simple!

          <h3 id="why-new-language">Why new language?</h3>

          <p>
            I think the pattern-matching of Egison is the big innovation in programming languages.<br/>
            Implementation of the Egison pattern-matching has big influence for whole design of the programming language.<br/>
            The patterns and the new notions <i>matchers</i>, which defines how to pattern-matching for each data type, have really important role as functions.<br/>
            What was the best design changes by introducing new pattern-matching.<br/>
            Additionally, I had to do a lot of experiments to theorize it.<br/>

          <h3 id="how-to-contriubute">How to contribute?</h3>
          
          <p>
            Please try Egison and give <a href="/~egi/">me</a> feedback.<br/>
            If it is interesting for you, please talk and tweet about Egison.<br/>
            What is the happiest thing for me is to read new Egison code by the people with various backgrounds.<br/>
            I believe Egison will be helpful and give breakthrough for the various fields in the way I've never imagine.<br/>
          </p>
          <p>
            I really appreciate if you could create the extensions of the other languages such as Haskell, Ruby and Python.<br/>
            I think these work will have great impact.<br/>
            I'd like to do that by myself.<br/>
            But I don't have thorough knowledge of each language to implement extensions, yet.<br/>

          <p>
            Pattern-matching of Egison is realized with backtracking as Prolog.<br/>
            The difference is that Egison realized these strong expression in pattern-matching.<br/>
            The pattern-matching itself of Prolog is similar with ordinal pattern-matching of the other functional languages.<br/>
            The mechanism of pattern-matching is briefly written <a href="/manual/mechanism.html">here</a>.
