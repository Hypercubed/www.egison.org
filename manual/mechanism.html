<h2 id ="notions">Notions</h2>

<p>
  We introduce several notations to explain Egison pattern matching mechanism.<br/>
  Here is a really brief explanation of each notation.<br/>
  We will deepen the understanding of these notions, examining the examples in the following sections.
</p>

<h3>Matching State</h3>

<p style="padding-left:20px;">
  Egison's pattern matching is reduction of a collection of <i>matching states</i>.<br/>
  Each matching-state has a stack of <i>matching-trees</i> and data to proceed pattern-matching.
</p>

<h3>Matching Tree</h3>

<p style="padding-left:20px;">
  A <i>matching-tree</i> has two kinds of forms, a matching-atom and a matching-node.
</p>

<h3>Matching Atom</h3>

<p style="padding-left:20px;">
  A matching atom is a tuple of a pattern, a target, and a matcher.
</p>

<h3>Matching Node</h3>

<p style="padding-left:20px;">
  A <i>matching-node</i> has a stack of matching-trees as a matching-state.<br/>
  The structure of matching-node is similar with a matching state.
</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<h3 id="example1">Example 1. Non-Linear Patterns</h3>

<p>
  Let us examine what will happen when Egison evaluates following pattern matching expressions.<br/>
</p>

<textarea class="code">(match-all {2 8 2} (multiset integer)
  [<cons $m <cons ,m _>> m])
;=>{2 2}</textarea>

<p>
  At first, the initial matching-state is generated.
  It is as follow.<br/>
  The data constructor <code>MState</code> takes three arguments, a stack of matching-trees, an environment, and a result in the middle of the pattern-matching.<br/>
  The <code>env</code> is the environment when the evaluation process enters the <code>match-all</code> expression.<br/>
  The stack of matching-tree contains a single matching-atom whose pattern, target and matcher are same with the arguments of <code>match-all</code>.
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {[<cons $m <cons ,m _>> {2 8 2} (multiset integer)]}
       env {}</textarea>

<p>
  The stack of the matching-tree contains only one matching-atom.<br/>
  This matching atom is reduced with the matcher <code>(multiset integer)</code> as specified in the matching-atom.<br/>
  The matching-states increases to 3 with this reduction as follow.<br/>
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {[$m 2 integer]
        [<cons ,m _> {8 2} (multiset integer)]}
       env {}

MState {[$m 8 integer] [<cons ,m _> {2 2} (multiset integer)]}
       env {}

MState {[$m 2 integer] [<cons ,m _> {2 8} (multiset integer)]}
       env {}</textarea>

<p>
  We focus on the first matching state, for now.<br/>
  It is the following one.
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {[$m 2 integer]
        [<cons ,m _> {8 2} (multiset integer)]}
       env {}</textarea>

<p>
  This matching-state is reduced as follow in the next reduction step.<br/>
  The matcher of the matching-atom of the top of the stack is changed to <code>something</code> from <code>integer</code>.<br/>
  <code>something</code> is the built-in matcher of Egison.<br/>
  It can match with a wildcard or a pattern variable.<br/>
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {[$m 2 something]
        [<cons ,m _> {8 2} (multiset integer)]}
       env {}</textarea>

<p>
  This matching-state is reduced as follow in the next reduction step.<br/>
  The matching atom of the top of the stack is popped out, and a new binding <code>[m 2]</code> is appended to the result of the middle of pattern-matching.<br/>
  <code>something</code> can only append a new binding to the result of pattern-matching.
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {[<cons ,m _> {8 2} (multiset integer)]}
       env {[m 2]}</textarea>

<p>
  This matching-state is reduced as follow in the next reduction step.<br/>
  The matching-states increases to 2 with this reduction.
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {[,m 2 integer]
        [_ {8} (multiset integer)]}
       env {[m 2]}

MState {[,m 8 integer]
        [_ {2} (multiset integer)]}
       env {[m 2]}</textarea>

<p>
  In the above matching-states, <code>,m</code> is pattern-matched with <code>8</code> and <code>2</code> respectively as <code>integer</code>.<br/>
  When we do pattern-matching with the value pattern, the result of the middle of pattern-matching is used to evaluate it.<br/>
  Therefore, in this case, <code>m</code> is evaluated to <code>2</code>.<br/>
  The first matching-state fails to pattern-match.<br/>
  The second matching-state succeeds in pattern-matching and be reduced as follow in the next reduction step.
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {[_ {8} (multiset integer)]}
       env {[m 2]}</textarea>

<p>
  This matching-state is reduced as follow in the next reduction step.<br/>
  The pattern is a wildcard and matches with any object.<br/>
  No new binding is appended to the result of pattern-matching.
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {}
       env {[m 2]}</textarea>

<p>
  When the matching-tree stack is empty, the reduction finish.<br/>
  This result of pattern-matching <code>{[m 2]}</code> is added to the final result.
</p>

<h3 id="example2">Example 2. Or-Patterns</h3>

<p>
  Let us examine what will happen when our system evaluates the following pattern-matching expression.
</p>

<textarea class="code">(match-all {1 1 2} (list integer)
   [<cons $m (| <nil> <cons ,m _>)> m])
;=>{1}</textarea>

<p>
  Our system reaches the following matching-state.
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {[(| <nil> <cons ,m _>) {1 2} (list integer)]}
       env {[m 1]}</textarea>

<p>
  This matching-state is reduced as follow in the next reduction step.
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {[<nil>       {1 2} (list integer)]}
       env {[m 1]}

MState {[<cons ,m _> {1 2} (list integer)]}
       env {[m 1]}</textarea>

<h3 id="example3">Example 3. And-Patterns</h3>

<p>
  Let us examine what will happen when our system evaluates the following pattern-matching expression.
</p>

<textarea class="code">(match-all {1 2 3} (list integer)
   [<cons $n (& <cons _ _> $rs)> [n rs]])
;=>{[1 {2 3}]}</textarea>

<p>
  Our system reaches the following matching-state.
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {[(& <cons _ _> $rs) {2 3} (list integer)]}
     env {[n 1]}</textarea>

<p>
  This matching-state is reduced as follow in the next reduction step.
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {[<cons _ _> {2 3} (list integer)]
        [$rs        {2 3} (list integer)]}
       env {[n 1]}</textarea>

<h3 id="example4">Example 4. Not-Patterns</h3>

<p>
  Let us examine what will happen when our system evaluates the following pattern-matching expression.
</p>

<textarea class="code">(match-all {2 8 2} (multiset integer)
   [<cons $m (& ^<cons ,m _> $rs)> [m rs]])
;=>{[8 {2 2}]}</textarea>

<p>
  Our system reaches the following matching-state.
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {[^<cons ,m _> {2 2} (multiset integer)]
        [$rs          {2 2} (multiset integer)]}
       env {[m 8]}</textarea>

<p>
  When our system reaches the matching-state whose top matching-atom is a not-pattern,
  our system generates a new matching-state which contains only the matching-atom with the not-pattern as follow.
  All information of the matching-state and the matching-nodes except about the rest of matching-tree stack are retained.
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {[<cons ,m _> {2 2} (multiset integer)]}
       env {[m 8]}</textarea>

<p>
  Our system proceeds the pattern-matching on the new generated matching-state,
  and if it fails pattern-matching our system pops out the matching-atom of the not-pattern from the original matching-state as follow and proceeds the pattern-matching.
  Otherwise our system fails the pattern-matching.
</p>

<p>
  In this case, the above matching-state succeeds pattern-matching.
  Therefore, the matching-state with the not-pattern is reduced as follow.
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {[$rs {2 2} (multiset integer)]}
       env {[m 8]}</textarea>

<h3 id="example5">Example 5. Application of Pattern Function Inside Pattern</h3>

<p>
  We explain how our system deals with modularization of patterns with this example.<br/>
  Let us examine what will happen when our system evaluates the following pattern-matching expression.
</p>

<textarea class="code">(define $twin
  (pattern-function [$pat1 $pat2]
    <cons (& $pat pat1)
     <cons ,pat
      pat2>>))

(match-all {1 2 1 3} (multiset integer)
  [<cons $m (twin $n _)> [m n]])
;=>{[2 1] [3 1] [2 1] [3 1]}</textarea>

<p>
  Our system reaches the following matching-state.
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {[(twin $n _) {1 1 3} (multiset integer)]}
       env {[m 2]}</textarea>

<p>
  This matching-state is reduced as follow in the next reduction step.
  A matching-node has extra information, a <i>pattern-environment</i>.
  In this case, the pattern-environment is <code>{[pat1 $n] [pat2 _]}</code>.
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {(MNode {[<cons (& $pat pat1) <cons ,pat pat2>>
                 {1 1 3} (multiset integer)]}
               env1 {} {[pat1 $n] [pat2 _]})}
       env {[m 2]}</textarea>

<p>
  Our system reaches the following matching-state.
  When the top of the matching-tree stack of the matching-state is a matching-node, our system pops the matching-atom of the top of the matching-tree stack of the matching-node.
  If the top of the matching-tree stack of the matching-node is a matching-node again, our system pops out the matching-atom from the top of the matching-tree stack of that matching-node.
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {(MNode {[pat1 1 integer]
                [<cons ,pat pat2> {1 3} (multiset integer)]}
               env1 {[pat 1]} {[pat1 $n] [pat2 _]})}
       env {[m 2]}</textarea>
  
<p>
  This matching-state is reduced as follow in the next reduction step.<br/>
  <code>pat1</code> is called a <i>variable-pattern</i>.<br/>
  It can appear only in the body of pattern-functions.<br/>
  When the matching-atom whose pattern is a variable-pattern is popped out,
  our system gets what pattern is bound to the variable-pattern from the pattern-environment,
  and push a new matching-atom to the matching-tree stack of the one level upper matching-node or matching-state.
</p>

<textarea class="code">MState {[$n 1 integer]
        (MNode {[<cons ,pat pat2> {1 3} (multiset integer)]}
               env1 {[pat 1]} {[pat1 $n] [pat2 _]})}
       env {[m 2]}</textarea>

<p>
  The arguments of a pattern-function are handled in special way as above.
  This is the reason why the pattern-function can take only patterns.
  A pattern must be bound to a variable-pattern.
</p>

<p>
  I'll stop the explanation of pattern matching step here, for now.<br/>
  I've explained most of the essential points, already.<br/>
</p>

<h2 id="infinite-results">Pattern-Matching with Infinite Results</h2>

<p>
  We explain how our system executes pattern-matching which has infinite results.
  Let us examine what will happen when our system evaluate the following pattern-matching expression.
</p>

<textarea class="code">(take 10 (match-all nat (set integer) [<cons $m <cons $n _>> [m n]]))
{[1 1] [1 2] [2 1] [1 3] [2 2] [3 1] [1 4] [2 3] [3 2] [4 1]}</textarea>

<p>
  The following picture is the reduction tree of matching-states when we execute the pattern-matching above.
  Rectangles stand for matching-states.
  The rectangle at the upper left is the initial matching-state.
  Circles stand for final matching-states that succeed pattern-matching.
</p>

<p>
  The width of a reduction tree of matching-states can be infinite because there are cases that a matching-state is reduced to infinite matching-states.
  The depth of a reduction tree also can be infinite if we use a recursive pattern-function in a pattern.
  We need to think on the order of reduction to examine all nodes of a reduction tree.
  The numbers on rectangles and circles denote the order of reduction.
  If we see a reduction tree obliquely, it can be regarded as a binary tree.
  Therefore, we can trace all nodes of reduction trees if we do breadth-first search on the tree, though it will use a lot of memory.
