<h2>Calculating the 9th Root of Unity</h2>

`x^9 - 1 = 0`

<p>
  This equation is factorized as follow.
</p>

`(x^3 - 1)(x^6 + x^3 + 1) = 0`

<p>
  Then, we solve the following equation.
</p>

`x^6 + x^3 + 1 = 0`

<p>
  The Galois group of this equation has same structure with the multiplicative group of `ZZ//7ZZ-{0}`.<br/>
  We can utilize this fact to solve this equation as follow.
</p>

<p>
  According to our calculation,
</p>

`cos((2pi)/9) = 1/2 (root 3 w + root 3 (w^2))`.
