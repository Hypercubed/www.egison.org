<h2>Calculating the 5th Root of Unity</h2>

<p>
  On the 5th root of unity, the following equation is known.
</p>

`cos((2pi)/5) = 1/4 (-1 + sqrt 5)`

<p>
  We calucuate this value in the following code in 2 ways.<br/>
</p>

<h2>Naive Approach</h2>

`x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0`

<p>
  We can divide the above equation with `x^2` (`x != 0` is obvious).
  Then we get
</p>

`(x + 1/x)^2 + (x + 1/x) - 1 = 0`.

<p>
  We can substitute `(x + 1/x)` in this equation with `t`.
</p>

`t = x + 1/x`

<p>
  In the above way, we can get the value of the 5th root of unity by solving quadratic equations twice.
<p>

(define $t (fst (q-f' 1 1 -1)));(/ (+ -1 (sqrt 5)) 2)
(define $z (fst (q-f' 1 (* -1 t) 1)));(/ (+ -1 (sqrt 5) (sqrt (+ -10 (* -2 (sqrt 5))))) 4)
(** z 5);1</textarea>

<h2>More General Solution Applying Galois Theory</h2>

`x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0`

<p>
  The Galois group of this equation has same structure with the multiplicative group of `ZZ//5ZZ-{0}`.<br/>
  We can utilize this fact to solve this equation as follow.
